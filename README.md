  + [Minimal PHP requirements](https://picocms.org/docs/#install) supported by most commercial hosts

  + Pico has a [plugin architecture](https://picocms.org/docs/#plugins).

### Pico is Straightforward

Pico does not have a backend. The menu is generated based on the folder structure of the content files. Most webmasters, communications personnel, administrative professionals and others are already familiar with: desktop file operations and text editing - easing their adoption of Pico. 

The routine work of maintaining Pico's content involve the familiar operations:

- Adding and editing text files.
- Moving files between folders.
- Adding images, documents (and other assets) to a folder.
